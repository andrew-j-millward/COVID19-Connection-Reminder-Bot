# COVID19-Connection-Reminder-Bot
Sends reminders to registered email addresses to contact loved ones daily during the COVID-19 pandemic. Users can register their email address at https://forms.gle/z5UBhSpDRLW6UGQo7, input their email address, select sending frequency, and they will automatically receive reminder emails every morning to contact their friends and families to let them know they are there during the isolating moments of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Edit: Thank you to everyone who signed up for this service while it was online! As lockdowns have eased nationwide, I have taken the service offline for the time being. I sincerely hope this project helped to bring you all closer to those you care about during this period of isolation.
